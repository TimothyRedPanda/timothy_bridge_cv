# Timothy Bridge
## Junior Software Developer

A visual CV to continue growing and developing, pardon the pun, as a developer. I aim to work on this project with a test-driven mindset with clean readable code that focuses on best practice.

### Getting Started

`git clone https://github.com/TimothyRedPanda/timothy_bridge_cv.git`

`cd timothy_bridge_cv`

`npm install` or `npm i`

`npm run dev`


### Current Testing/Security

* Husky - to manage my pre-commits - both formatting (with biome) and code scanning (Snyk).

* Snyk for automatic code scan and dependencies scan, I am prevented from committing if these scans fail.

* Jest for unit testing, a Jest script will also be added to Husky to prevent commiting without the unit tests passing.
